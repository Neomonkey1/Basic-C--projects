# C# and .NET Projects
Here are a lot of small projects and a few big ones I did for "The Tech Academy" using C# and .NET framework.

## Projects
[TwentyOne](https://github.com/Neomonkey1/Basic-C--projects/tree/main/TwentyOne)

- Made a console Black Jack game. To make this game we used classes, class inheritance and different libraries from the .NET framework.
- Also made lots of different methods, IF ELSE statements, WHILE loops, exception handling and more. 

[Car Insurance](https://github.com/Neomonkey1/Basic-C--projects/tree/main/CarInsurance)
- This is a WebApp using MVC.
- The WebApp mimics a basic car insurance website that takes in user's input on policy information.
- Using that policy information to calculate a quote base of business logic.
- Made Admin page that allows staff to view all quotes that have been issued.
