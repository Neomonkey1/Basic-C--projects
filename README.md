## Projects
[TwentyOne](https://github.com/Neomonkey1/Basic-C--projects/tree/main/TwentyOne)

- Made a console Black Jack game. To make this game we used classes, class inheritance and different libraries from the .NET framework.
- Also made lots of different methods, IF ELSE statements, WHILE loops, exception handling and more.
